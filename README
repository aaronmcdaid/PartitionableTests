  cd code
  make NSC
  cd ../simulations
  make  # to see a sample run

The binary (code/NSC) just sends its result to stdout.
Run it without parameters for usage instructions.
In the 'simulations' folder, I have a makefile to run the software and process the results into a suitable tab-delimited text file.
